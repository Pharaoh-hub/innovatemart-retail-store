# InnovateMart Retail Store Sample App

This is a cloud-native, microservices-based retail store application built and deployed independently by **John Oladoye (pharaoh-hub)**. Over six days, I designed, containerized, and deployed this app to AWS EKS using Terraform and GitHub Actions. Every line of code, every configuration, and every deployment step was written and executed by me â€” no templates, no shortcuts.

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific domain, and a Node.js frontend served via Nginx. All services are containerized and deployed to Kubernetes on AWS EKS.

### ðŸ”§ Components

- **Frontend**: Node.js UI served via Nginx
- **Microservices**:
  - `carts`: manages shopping cart operations
  - `catalog`: handles product listings
  - `orders`: processes customer orders
  - `checkout`: coordinates final purchase flow
  - `payment`: simulates payment processing
  - `notification`: sends order confirmations
- **Databases**:
  - MySQL for orders
  - PostgreSQL for catalog
  - Redis for carts
  - RabbitMQ for notifications
- **Infrastructure**:
  - AWS EKS cluster provisioned via Terraform
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
  - Kubernetes manifests for service deployment

## ðŸš€ Deployment Workflow

### 1. **Terraform Infrastructure Setup**
- Created `main.tf`, `eks.tf`, `vpc.tf`, `subnets.tf`, `iam.tf`, and `gateway.tf`
- Defined VPC, subnets, security groups, IAM roles, and EKS cluster
- Used `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to provision infrastructure
- Verified cluster access with `aws eks update-kubeconfig` and `kubectl get nodes`

### 2. **Microservices Containerization**
- Wrote Dockerfiles for each service from scratch
- Tagged and pushed images to Amazon ECR
- Verified container health locally using `docker run` and `curl`

### 3. **Kubernetes Manifests**
- Created deployment and service YAMLs for each microservice
- Configured environment variables, ports, and resource limits
- Applied manifests using `kubectl apply -f`
- Verified pods and services with `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl get svc`

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml` for GitHub Actions
- Configured GitHub Secrets:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `EKS_CLUSTER_NAME`
  - `AWS_REGION`
- Workflow steps:
  - Checkout code
  - Configure AWS credentials
  - Setup `kubectl`
  - Update kubeconfig
  - Apply Kubernetes manifests

### 5. **Frontend Integration**
- Developed UI in Node.js using Express
- Linked API endpoints via environment variables
- Configured Nginx with custom `default.conf`
- Deployed UI to EKS using `ui-deployment.yaml`

## ðŸ§ª Local Development

During development, I tested the UI locally before deploying to EKS. Here's how I ran it:

```bash
cd src/ui
npm install
npm start
 
This launched the Node.js frontend on localhost:3000, allowing me to verify layout, API connectivity, and theme switching. I manually configured environment variables to point to local or remote microservices depending on the test scenario.
I also tested individual microservices using docker run and curl, ensuring each service responded correctly before integrating them into the Kubernetes cluster.

Lessons Learned
- Mastered Terraform modules and AWS IAM roles
- Debugged Kubernetes networking and service exposure
- Built a secure CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Handled Git authentication, submodule issues, and token-based access
- Gained confidence in cloud-native architecture and DevOps workflows
